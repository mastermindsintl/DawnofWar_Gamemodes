# Onslaught

A custom victory condition for "Dawn of War Dark Crusade 3rd Generation" mod

Survive against waves of Orks! All player characters must team up against computer players, and survive until they kill enough Orks.
## THIS IS A MODIFICATION OF THE zombieapocalypse.scar FILE! I DID NOT CREATE THE ORIGINAL FILE.
I only created my own version of the victory condition to make it more fun for myself.
## How to Install & Use

Place both files into the Dawn of War Dark Crusade\DOW3G_3_1\Data\scar\winconditions folder.

You must have Dawn of War Dark Crusade 3rd Generation installed.

Find it [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40000dawnofwar/mods/303)

Load the game and select the "Onslaught" victory condition. It is mutually exclusive, and cannot be mixed with other win conditions.
## Alterations:

- Players start with 9999 Requisition and Power
- Players start with a Commander unit, two builders, and two infantry squads
- Players MUST build their HQ when the game begins, they do not start with one
- Full infantry and vehicle production is allowed
- Players may capture requsition points, but enemies may not (Feedback?)
- Tyranids do not play well, as they are not very defensive oriented... (Feedback?)
- The "Reinforcements" mechanic has been effectively disabled
- Slugga Boyz and Burna Boyz are the main horde enemy players will face
- Orks gain additional HP in higher difficulties
- WAAAAAAGHs will occur, which spawn a large number of Orks at once
- WAAAAAAGHs may spawn in 'Ard Boyz and a Warboss
- Higher difficulties will cause WAAAAAAGHs to occur more often
- Insane difficulty requires players to hold out against almost 10,000 Orks and constant WAAAAAAGHs
- The original zombie "bite" mechanic has been removed

# Last Stand

Survive for a time based amount against random waves of Chaos forces!
